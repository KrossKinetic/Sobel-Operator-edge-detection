# Sobel-Operator-edge-detection
This simple program performs sobel operator edge detection on an image.
The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobelâ€“Feldman operator or Sobel filter, is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges.
